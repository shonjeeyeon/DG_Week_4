# Data Glacier Week 4: Deployment of a Machine Learning Model into PaaS

**Business Problem**
Prescribing and administrering appropriate medications based on patients' indications and lab values are critical in optimizing medication therapy. In the dataset, five medications were labeled as X, Y, A, B, and C, and five patient-related dependent variables(i.e. age, sex, blood pressure, Na to K ratio, and cholesterol) were provided. In this project, a multilabel classification model will be developed to predict medications based on independent variables, and the model will be deployed into a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) using Heroku.

**Summary**
Random Forest was able to predict the medication based on the dependent variables with an accuracy score of 98.85%. The deployed application is available as a link provided on the right side of the repository.
